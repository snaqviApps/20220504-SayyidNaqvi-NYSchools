This project is displaying a School-Data as per requirement such that:
     - fetches data using a publically available api for NY-Schools [https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/DOE-High-School-Directory-2017/s3k6-pzi2]
     - fetches the data for mostly similar schools with additional info for the matched school: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/SAT-Results/f9bf-2cp4:  
     - contains SAT scores - include Math, Reading and Writing. 
   
   
   - pleaes note: 
     **this implementation is different as it pre-filters the matching shcool info to its SAT details, hence no different screen is required**
